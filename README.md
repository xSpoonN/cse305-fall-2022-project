The file "DB INIT STATEMENTS" contains optional statements to initialize the database. The dump should already have these init statements, but just in case they don't we included them here.

If the database cannot be found for whatever reason, check the variable "dmConn" in "src/main/java/dao/LoginDao.java". These variables declared at the top of the file, and include the location of the database and the username and password. We used the SBU-provided MySQL Server to host it instead of localhost.
